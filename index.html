                <h2>Grilled Fish</h2>
                <p>Grilling fish is a much healthier option than frying fish.Cooking fish on a high heat makes sure
                    that the fish is cooked well, crispy and flaky. This simple grilled fish recipe can be made in an
                    oven, barbecue kits, or simply on the gas too. It tastes delicious and can be had as it is or an
                    accompaniment to rice. When making grilled fish it is important to choose a large fish or fillet
                    that is firm and fresh.</p>

                <h2>Easy Vegetarian Chili</h2>
                <p>Soup season is here! There’s a lot to love about fall – beautiful weather, changing leaves, cozy
                    baked goods and hot drinks – but the soup recipes are hands down my favorite part. I adore soup. I
                    love making it, I love eating it, and I love packing up the leftovers so that I can enjoy it again
                    the next day. When I’m stressed, I turn to soup because I find it meditative to cook. When I’m
                    snowed in, I turn to it because I keep a stash stored away in my freezer. And when I’m in need of a
                    healthy reset, I turn to it because it just makes me feel good inside.</p>
